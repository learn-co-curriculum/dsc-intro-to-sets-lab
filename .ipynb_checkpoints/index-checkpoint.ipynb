A common example is in the game of poker or related card games, where players try to calculate the probability of winning a round given the cards they have in their hands. Also in the business context probabilities play an important role. Operating in an volatile economy, companies need to take uncertainty into account and this is exactly where probability theory plays a role.\n",
